# Code Institute Milestone Project - 1
## The Jones Music

A clean and responsive website for a band, targeting both their current and potential future audience.
This website is used to promote the bands music while also making it easy for potential clients and/or fans to book them to perform at events, weddings etc.
The website layout was based around their primary and secondary targets for the website.

## UX

Firstly a set of wireframe diagrams where made to show the layout of the website on different screen sizes and was also used to iron out any potential issues that arose before coding the website.[Link To Wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/93b734fd-348a-414f-69f4-79c2324e39f7-e586/)

The websites layout is designed so that each primary and secondary target has its own section on the page and is easily found both via the fixed top navbar or by scrolling on the page itself.
For the user I did not want to overwhelm them with information so I kept unnecessary content such as the "Book Now" form to it's own page and give them a simple Contact Us form instead. 

Depending on the screen size some content is removed but is viewable on a dedicated page, an example of this is the Band section in the homepage is not viewable on mobile devices but is viewable in the Our Band webpage. 

## Features

### Homepage
The Navbar is used to bring the fans/clients directly to the content they wish to see immediatly, it is fixed also so that they can use it no matter where they are on a page. Links to the bands social media are also seen here and at the bottom of each webpage.

I used the Bootstrap carousel with a background image to catch the users eye immediatly and promote the bands next gig and their availabilty for events and weddings.

The What We Do section provides an easily readable version of what the band offers.

The Band section explains each band members role, it is also clickable should the user want to find out more about the band.

Our Music section provides a small number of videos and audio of the bands music while the button at the button makes it easy for the user to see more. 

The following section is split in two, the left is a carousel showing some recent reviews of the band to build trust. The right is a Contact Us section should the user have any questions.

#### Future Development
In a future version I would like to add a map feature showcasing the venues the band have played in using droplets on the map with information being shown such as Place Name, Date, Images, Video, Reviews etc. when they are clicked. 

In a future version provide a way for users to purchase music from the band either by download or by CD. 

### Our Band Page

Used to provide the user with more information about the band and to showcase past accomplishments and a collage of photo's to show off the band members.

### Our Music Page

Provides a full range of content of the bands music videos and audio.

### Events Page

Provides information of the types of events that they do while also giving the client video of a past type of event to showcase what they offer. 

### Book Now Page

A simple booking form used by the client to book a type of event for a certain date.
While allowing the band easily collect the information they need.  

## Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3
Used for displaying the content and layout.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Used to make the website clean and responsive.
Also used its built in features such as carousels and forms.

[Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
Required for Bootstrap components to run properly.

[jQuery](http://code.jquery.com/)
Required for Bootstrap components to run properly.

## Testing
As the webpages where being built I used the built in features of [Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) and Google Chrome's built in developer tools. 

I firstly tested the index.html page and stylesheet first as the information used on this page is used on the following pages. 
After each section was developed I,
1. made sure the content was responsive and laid out correctly as per the origional wireframe on desktop, tablet and mobile devices using the Chrome developer tools.
2. made sure all links are correct
3. made sure the code layout is correctly indented so it can be easily read. 

After each page was finished I used the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), to make sure both the HTML and CSS was up to current standards and best practice. I also made sure the code layout is correct for a final time and that all links and media work correctly.
